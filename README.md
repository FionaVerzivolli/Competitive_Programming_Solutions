# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from various platforms. Each solution is organized by platform and labeled according to the problem number.

## Repository Structure

- **Folders**: Each folder is named after the platform where the problem is hosted (e.g., `LeetCode`, `Codeforces`, `HackerRank`).
- **Files**: Each file within a folder is named after the problem number, followed by the appropriate file extension (e.g., `404.cpp` for problem 404). The majority of the solutions are implemented in C++.


## How to Navigate

1. **Select a platform**: Navigate to the folder corresponding to the platform where the problem is hosted.
2. **Find the problem**: Inside the folder, locate the file named with the problem number you're interested in.
3. **View the solution**: Open the file to view my solution to the problem.

## Languages Used

- **C++**: Most of the solutions are implemented in C++.
- **Python**
